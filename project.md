# Legend

Visual Codebase Map — Interactive Prototype

## Part 1: Product Overview

**Legend** is a visual codebase exploration tool that auto-generates interactive architecture diagrams from any GitHub repository. Users connect their GitHub account, select a repo, and instantly see a beautiful, navigable map of how their code is structured.

**Tagline:**
*"Understand any codebase instantly"*

**This is a visual prototype.** It should look and feel like a real, polished product. All interactions should be simulated with realistic demo data. No backend required — all data is hardcoded.
